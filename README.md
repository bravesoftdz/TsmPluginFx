# TsmPluginFramework
Plugin framework for TransModeler traffic simulator. It wrapps up TransModeler's raw TsmApi COM interfaces, Parameter Editor interface, Vehicle Monitor APIs, and Gisdk scripting into a unified high-level appliaction framework. 

RemObject Oxygene/Pascal for native Win32 platform is used together with C/C++ in implementing the framework.

This framework enables developing TransModeler plugins with integrated scripted Graphical User Interface, parameter configurations, and core business logic - all in a unified workflow.
